# lean-mod

Adds Lean to Minecraft

Why is this a thing? Well the only other lean mod is closed source and exclusive to 1.13

It's also my first project on a real IDE.

## Adds

• Lean Potions and Arrow

• Lean Fluid

• Lean Bucket

## Features

• The potion gives you Blindness, Weakness, Mining Fatigue,
Nausea, Hunger and Slowness, all level V, to represent the dangers of real lean.

This is so scuffed, I'm sorry
